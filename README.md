# React Kanban

â€¢ A kanban board/task manager SPA built with **React.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**.

This single-page application allows users to make "to do" cards for tasks, assign a priority (high, low, medium) to each task, and categorize it based on whether it's been completed or not ("to do", "doing", or "done").
